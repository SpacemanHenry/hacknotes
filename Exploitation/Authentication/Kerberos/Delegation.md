# [Delegation](https://www.thehacker.recipes/ad/movement/kerberos/delegations)

## Questions to ask yourself
  *  Any unconstrained objects [kerberoastable](https://github.com/SpacemanHenry/hacknotes/blob/main/Exploitation/Authentication/Kerberos/Kerberoast.md)?
  *  What services have service principal names configured?
      *  What users have high privileges over those services?

## Things to remember
  *  Unconstrained delegation requires changes from default config for user accounts

## Useful tools
  *  [`krbrelayx`](https://github.com/dirkjanm/krbrelayx) toolkit for abusing unconstrained delegation
  *  [`impacket-getST`](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/getST.py) for impersonating users via constrained delegation
