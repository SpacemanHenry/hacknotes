# CreateRemoteThread shellcode injection

## Things to remember
  *  ired.team has a [page covering this](https://www.ired.team/offensive-security/code-injection-process-injection/process-injection)
  *  One of the most basic process injection methods: likely to be detected
  *  `CreateRemoteThread` can be used for more than just shellcode
      *  Ex. forcing a process to invoke a Win32 API function (see [vanilla DLL injection](https://github.com/SpacemanHenry/hacknotes/tree/main/Post%20Exploitation/Evasion/Process%20Injection/DLL%20Injection))

## How it works  
  *  Obtain handle to target process
  *  Allocate memory in target process matching shellcode size
  *  Write shellcode bytes to allocated memory
  *  Spawn new thread in target process pointing to shellcode

## Compilation  
  *  Easy to cross-compile for windows from linux using `go`
  *  Always replace the payload, and mind the architecture! (duh)
  *  Change the `PID` value within the `const` block before deployment

```
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o CreateRemoteThread.exe main.go
GOOS=windows GOARCH=386 go build -o CreateRemoteThread.exe main.go
```
